                        Choose your hero and clash on the battle fields of tomorrow.
                        Bend time, defy physics, and wield extraordinary powers in the ultimate team-based shooter.

                        The reason I love playing this game is because it's different then your average shooter. In this game you don't have to be mechanically the best but tactically and smart. it's more about your positioning and in-game sense.

                        I like to play tank mainly Zarya who's task is to push the enemy and protect teammates with bubbles who protecs them from damage, you can make some gaming winning saves with it. In the support class I like to play ana the most she is the sniping healer. shooting at teammates heals them shooting at enemy's damages them. In the dps category I like to play genji the most the japanese cyborg ninja is a high skill hero but pays off when you know how to play him. While taking a glimpse of the 26 heroes and counting there is alot of versatility in the heroes and for everyone is probably one they like most!
